# Overview
ShootPoints Web is a set of programs for total station surveying. Based on the SiteMap surveying package originally developed at the Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA) at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, ShootPoints Web streamlines and simplifies total station operation and data collection on archaeological excavations.

ShootPoints Web consists of two interrelated projects: shootpoints-web-api and shootpoints-web-frontend. Because shootpoints-web-frontend cannot be run independently of shootpoints-web-api, you are directed to that project for installation and use instructions: [https://github.com/Lugal-PCZ/shootpoints-web-api](https://github.com/Lugal-PCZ/shootpoints-web-api).
