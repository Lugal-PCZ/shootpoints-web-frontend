# Overview
ShootPoints-Web is a set of programs for total station surveying. Based on the [SiteMap](https://www.academia.edu/78544111/SiteMap_Innovations_in_Computer_Based_Mapping_for_Archaeologists) surveying package originally developed at the Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA) at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, ShootPoints-Web streamlines and simplifies total station operation and data collection on archaeological excavations. Developed independently, it was heavily tested and refined at the Penn Museum projects at Ur and [Lagash](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/lagash/), Iraq.

ShootPoints-Web consists of two interrelated projects: shootpoints-web-api and shootpoints-web-frontend. Because shootpoints-web-frontend cannot be run independently of shootpoints-web-api, you are directed to the ShootPoints-Web project for installation and use instructions: [https://github.com/Lugal-PCZ/ShootPoints-Web](https://github.com/Lugal-PCZ/ShootPoints-Web).
